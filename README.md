📊 Hospitality Revenue Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

🚩 Problem Statement
Hotel management teams struggled with manual reporting across multiple booking sources, leading to:
➡️ Delayed insights into revenue trends and occupancy.
➡️ No structured KPI monitoring (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy).
➡️ Difficulty identifying seasonal demand patterns and top-performing properties.
➡️ Lack of data-driven decision-making for pricing, expansion, and cost optimization.

✅ Solution Approach
🔹 Data Ingestion & Cleaning (ETL)
➡️ Imported and cleaned 100K+ booking records from fact_bookings.csv using SQL Server + Power Query.
➡️ Transformed data into a star-schema model for efficient analysis.

🔹 SQL Data Modeling & Analysis
➡️ Built Time Series Analysis (WoW, MoM, YoY revenue growth, rolling averages) to uncover seasonal demand patterns.
➡️ Designed revenue breakdowns by city, property, room category, and weekday for granular insights.

🔹 Power BI Dashboard Development
➡️ Created dynamic KPIs with DAX: RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy.
➡️ Built interactive visuals (trend lines, heatmaps, property comparisons).
➡️ Automated refresh pipelines → reduced manual reporting time by 80%.
