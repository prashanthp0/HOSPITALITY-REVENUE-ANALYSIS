# HOSPITALITY-REVENUE-ANALYSIS
üìä Hospitality Revenue Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)
üö© Problem Statement
Hotel management teams struggled with manual reporting across multiple booking sources, leading to:

Delayed insights into revenue trends and occupancy.

No structured KPI monitoring (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy).

Difficulty identifying seasonal demand patterns and top-performing properties.

Lack of data-driven decision-making for pricing, expansion, and cost optimization.

‚úÖ Solution Approach
Designed and implemented an end-to-end BI project integrating SQL and Power BI:

Data Ingestion & Cleaning (ETL)

Imported and cleaned 100K+ booking records from fact_bookings.csv using SQL Server, and Power Query.

Transformed data into a star-schema model for efficient analysis.

SQL Data Modeling & Analysis


Built Time Series Analysis (WoW, MoM, YoY revenue growth, rolling averages) to uncover seasonal demand patterns.

Designed revenue breakdowns by city, property, room category, and weekday for granular insights.

Power BI Dashboard Development

Created dynamic KPIs with DAX for RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy.

Built interactive visuals (trend lines, heatmaps, property comparisons).

Automated refresh pipelines, reducing manual reporting time by 80%.
